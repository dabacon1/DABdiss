Growl and Roar

Tablet/browser forced choice novel word learning tasks 

This  task is intended to introduce participants to a human informant that matches them along multiple social dimensions and a human informant that matches them only on gender or race. These informants are equally knowledgeable on objects familiar to participants (ie apple, ball, etc.) and as such provide the same correctlabel for these objects. The manipulation is that the ingroup and outgroup informants provide conflicting labels for novel objects. The goal of this task is to see what label participants believe is correct for each novel object. This will hopefully provide insight into who the participants believe is the more knowledgeable/more trustworthy informant.
